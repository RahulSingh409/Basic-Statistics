    "## BACKGROUND:\n",
    "\n",
    "When an order is placed by a customer of a small manufacturing company, a price quote must be developed for that order. Because each order is unique, quotes must be established on an order-by-order basis by a pricing expert. The price quote process is laborintensive, as prices depend on many factors such as the part number, customer, geographic location, market, and order volume. The sales department manager is concerned that the pricing process is too complex, and that there might be too much variability in the quoted prices. An improvement team is tasked with studying and improving the pricing process. After interviewing experts to develop a better understanding of the current process, the team designed a study to determine if there is variability between pricing experts. That is, do different pricing experts provide different price quotes? Two randomly selected pricing experts, Mary and Barry, were asked to independently provide prices for twelve randomly selected orders. Each\n",
    "expert provided one price for each of the twelve orders.\n",

    "We would like to assess if there is any difference in the average\n",
    "price quotes provided by Mary and Barry.\n",

    "## DATA AVAILABLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains the order number, 1 through 12, and the price quotes by Mary\n",
    "and Barry for each order. Each row in the data set is the same order. Thus, Mary and\n",
    "Barry produced quotes for the same orders.\n",
