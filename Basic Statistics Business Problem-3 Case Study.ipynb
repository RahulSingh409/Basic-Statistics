    "## BACKGROUND:\n",
    "\n",
    "The New Life Residential Treatment Facility is a NGO that treats teenagers who have shown signs of mental illness. It provides housing and supervision of teenagers who are making the transition from psychiatric hospitals back into the community. Because many of the teenagers were severely abused as children and have been involved with the juvenile justice system, behavioral problems are common at New Life. Employee pay is low and staff turnover (attrition) is high. A reengineering program was instituted at New Life with the goals of lowering behavioral problems of the kids and decreasing employee turnover rates. As a part of this effort, the following changes were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Employee shifts were shortened from 10 hours to 8 hours each day.\n",
    "     Employees were motivated to become more involved in patient treatments. This included encouraging staff to run various therapeutic treatment sessions and allowing staff to have more say in program changes.\n",
    "     The activities budget was increased.\n",
    "     A facility-wide performance evaluation system was put into place that rewarded staff participation and innovation.\n",
    "     Management and staff instituted a program designed to raise expectations about appropriate behavior from the kids. This included strict compliance with reporting of behavioral violations, insistence on participation in therapeutic sessions, and a     lowered tolerance for even moderate behavioral infractions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To determine the effectiveness of the reengineering effort, a data set comprised of pre- and post-reengineering periods was compiled. The information contains two measures of behavioral problems. A critical incident occurs when a resident goes AWOL (leaves the premises without permission), destroys property (e.g., punching a hole in a wall or throwing furniture through windows), is caught in possession of street drugs, or engages in assault against other residents or staff members. A teenager is temporarily removed from the facility when s/he is sent to jail or back to a psychiatric hospital\n",
    "\n",
    "## BUSINESS PROBLEM:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine what effect, if any, the reengineering effort had on the incidence behavioral problems and staff turnover. i.e To determine if the reengineering effort changed the critical incidence rate. Is there evidence that the critical incidence rate\n",
    "improved?\n",
    "\n",
    "## DATA AVAILABLE:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains 20 months of data; the first 13 months were prior to reengineering. The variables in the data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Reengineer: Whether the month was before (Prior) or after (Post) reengineering\n",
    "     Employee Turnover: The percentage of employees who quit in a given month, out of the total number of employees\n",
    "     TRFF(%): The percentage of residents who were temporarily removed from the facility, out of the total number of residents\n",
    "     CI (%): The percentage of critical incident reports written that month, out of the total number of residents\n",
